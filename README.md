This masterpiece has been rigorously tested, utilizing a dataset of 200 images per option. The webcam diligently collects data as you make your selection. Based on this data, the trained model generates a prediction, selecting the option with the highest probability. The computer, ever so ingeniously, then randomly generates its own choice of either Stone, Paper, or Scissors. These choices are pitted against each other in a glorious duel, all initiated with a single press of the "Fight" button.

The exhilarating battle continues as long as you press the "Start" and "Stop" buttons with unerring precision.

Prepare yourself for an unforgettable experience as you partake in the timeless game of Rock Paper Scissors, now elevated to new heights of sophistication.
